** Early Modern English
In days of yore, in a verdant meadow, there dwelled a small creature named Wulf. Wulf was a cunning fox, swift of foot and sharp of mind. One fine morn, as the sun did rise, Wulf ventured forth in search of adventure.

Through the woods and o'er the hills, Wulf scampered with glee. He encountered a wise owl in a towering oak, who spoke in hoots and riddles. The owl said, "To find great treasure, young Wulf, thou must seek the Eldertree deep in the heart of the enchanted forest."

With courage in his heart, Wulf journeyed on. The woods grew dark, and shadows danced beneath the ancient branches. Yet, Wulf pressed forward, guided by the glimmering moonlight that pierced through the leaves.

As he approached the Eldertree, a magical presence filled the air. The Eldertree spoke, its voice a gentle breeze that rustled the leaves. "Brave Wulf," it whispered, "to uncover the treasure, answer me this: What is the key to friendship and the door to happiness?"

Wulf pondered, his clever mind at work. "The key to friendship," he said, "is trust, and the door to happiness opens with kindness."

The Eldertree nodded with approval, and the ground beneath it trembled. Suddenly, a burst of light revealed a hidden entrance to a secret chamber. Wulf entered and found a chest adorned with precious gems and golden trinkets.

But, instead of keeping the treasure for himself, Wulf thought of his friends in the meadow. He decided to share the riches, spreading joy and laughter throughout the land.

And so, the small fox returned to the meadow, not only with treasures but also with a heart full of warmth. The other creatures gathered around, and together they celebrated the spirit of friendship and the joy of sharing.

And from that day forth, the meadow echoed with the laughter of friends, and the legend of Wulf and the Eldertree became a cherished tale told under the moonlit sky.
